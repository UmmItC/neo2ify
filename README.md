Neo-Store Export Formatter for Droid-ify

As a long-time user of Neostore, I've noticed it becoming increasingly sluggish and less smooth after recent updates. Fed up with the lag, I've decided to switch to Droid-ify. However, there's a problem â€“ Droid-ify doesn't support Neo-store formatting. This script aims to bridge the gap, ensuring a seamless transition for users like me.

>Notes: At the moment, support is only available for favorite apps. Please handle other changes, such as implementing a dark or light theme, on your own.

### Usage

```shell
python main.py --input NS.xts --output fdroid-ify.json
```
